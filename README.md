# Hi, I'm Rosie üåè  
## *Multi-Skilled Designer | Front-End Developer*

<br/> I'm a passionate designer with a diverse background in Architectural Design, UX/UI Design, and Graphic Design.<br/> Currently, I'm expanding my expertise into Front-End Development through an intensive bootcamp and self-directed learning.

**What I Do** ‚ú® <br/>
Graphic Design: Creating compelling visuals that communicate effectively.<br/>
UX/UI Design: Designing user-centric interfaces with a focus on seamless user experiences.<br/>
Front-End Development: Bridging the gap between design and development, currently focusing on React & NextJS.

**My Journey** üöÄ<br/>
From graphic and web design to progressing into UX/UI, my journey has always been driven by a love for creating beautiful and functional designs. Now, as I develop my Front-End skills, I aim to deliver complete digital solutions that are as functional as they are aesthetic.
