Hi, I'm Rosie 🌏
Multi-Skilled Designer | Trainee Front-End Developer | 
I'm a passionate designer with a diverse background in Architectural Design, UX/UI Design, and Graphic Design. Currently, I'm expanding my expertise into Front-End Development through an intensive bootcamp and self-directed learning.

What I Do ✨
Graphic Design: Creating compelling visuals that communicate effectively.
UX/UI Design: Designing user-centric interfaces with a focus on seamless user experiences.
Front-End Development: Bridging the gap between design and development, currently honing my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.

My Journey 🚀
From graphic and web design to progressing into UX/UI, my journey has always been driven by a love for creating beautiful and functional designs. Now, as I develop my Front-End skills, I aim to deliver complete digital solutions that are as functional as they are aesthetic.
